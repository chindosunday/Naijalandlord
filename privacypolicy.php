            <span> 
             Upon trying to rent a house, you will be required to login to continue your payment. But because signing up is optional, you reserve the right not to register. 
             However, just as we stated earlier, refusing to disclose your data will limit the service you will enjoy on our plartform. However, you still have the option of transacting with the house owners outside this plartform.
             However, because we cannot guarantee what happens outside our plartform, our privacy policy cannot protect you in the event of fraud or dubious home owners. </span>
